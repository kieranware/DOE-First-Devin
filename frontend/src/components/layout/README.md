# Layout Components

This directory will contain the main layout components for the Employee Experience Platform:

- `Header.tsx` - Contains the top navigation bar with language toggle and user profile
- `Sidebar.tsx` - Smart left menu that adapts to user personas
- `MainContent.tsx` - Container for the main content area
- `AnalyticsPanel.tsx` - Right side panel for analytics and information
- `Layout.tsx` - Main layout component that combines all the above

These components will be implemented in the next step of the project.
