# Accessibility Compliance Report

## Overview
This report documents the accessibility compliance of the Employee Experience Platform with WCAG 2.2 AA standards. The platform has been designed and implemented with accessibility as a core requirement, ensuring that all users, including those with disabilities, can effectively use the system.

## WCAG 2.2 AA Compliance

### 1. Perceivable

#### 1.1 Text Alternatives
- ✅ All non-text content has text alternatives
- ✅ Icons include aria-labels or are decorative only
- ✅ Images include alt text

#### 1.2 Time-based Media
- ✅ No time-based media in the current implementation

#### 1.3 Adaptable
- ✅ Information and structure can be programmatically determined
- ✅ Semantic HTML is used throughout the application
- ✅ Meaningful sequence is maintained in the DOM

#### 1.4 Distinguishable
- ✅ Color is not used as the only means of conveying information
- ✅ Contrast ratios meet AA standards (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- ✅ Text can be resized up to 200% without loss of content or functionality
- ✅ Images of text are not used where actual text would serve the same purpose

### 2. Operable

#### 2.1 Keyboard Accessible
- ✅ All functionality is available from a keyboard
- ✅ No keyboard traps
- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts are provided for common actions

#### 2.2 Enough Time
- ✅ No time limits are set by the content
- ✅ Auto-updating content can be paused, stopped, or hidden

#### 2.3 Seizures and Physical Reactions
- ✅ No content flashes more than three times per second

#### 2.4 Navigable
- ✅ Skip to content link is provided
- ✅ Pages have descriptive titles
- ✅ Focus order preserves meaning and operability
- ✅ Link purpose can be determined from the link text alone

#### 2.5 Input Modalities
- ✅ Pointer gestures are simple
- ✅ Pointer cancellation is supported
- ✅ Form inputs have appropriate labels
- ✅ Motion actuation is not used

### 3. Understandable

#### 3.1 Readable
- ✅ Language of page is programmatically determined
- ✅ Language of parts can be programmatically determined
- ✅ Bilingual support (English and Irish) is implemented correctly

#### 3.2 Predictable
- ✅ Components that receive focus do not initiate a change of context
- ✅ Changing the setting of a user interface component does not automatically cause a change of context
- ✅ Navigation mechanisms are consistent across the application

#### 3.3 Input Assistance
- ✅ Error identification is clear
- ✅ Labels and instructions are provided for user input
- ✅ Error suggestion is provided when possible
- ✅ Error prevention for legal, financial, and data submissions

### 4. Robust

#### 4.1 Compatible
- ✅ Markup is valid and well-formed
- ✅ Name, role, and value of UI components can be programmatically determined
- ✅ Status messages can be programmatically determined

## Screen Reader Testing

The application has been tested with the following screen readers:

1. **NVDA (Windows)**
   - Navigation through all pages works correctly
   - Form inputs are properly labeled and announced
   - Dynamic content updates are announced appropriately

2. **VoiceOver (macOS)**
   - All interactive elements are accessible
   - Language switching is announced correctly
   - Form validation errors are properly communicated

## Keyboard Navigation

The application supports comprehensive keyboard navigation:

- **Tab Order**: Logical and follows visual layout
- **Focus Indicators**: Visible focus indicators for all interactive elements
- **Shortcuts**:
  - Skip to content: Alt+1
  - Language toggle: Alt+L
  - Instance selector: Alt+I
  - User menu: Alt+U

## UI Component Alignment with Storybook Design System

All UI components have been implemented according to the Access Group Storybook design system. The following components have been verified:

### Button Component
- ✅ Implements all required properties: colourVariant, variant, size, radius, compactVersion
- ✅ Supports icons (leftSection, rightSection)
- ✅ Follows design system styling for all states (default, hover, focus, active, disabled)

### Card Component
- ✅ Implements all required properties: colourVariant, hasBorder, hasBounce, padding, testId
- ✅ Supports title and content structure
- ✅ Follows design system styling for borders, shadows, and spacing

### Divider Component
- ✅ Implements all required properties: margin, testId, thickness
- ✅ Follows design system styling for horizontal and vertical dividers

### Form Components
- ✅ Input, Select, and Checkbox components follow design system patterns
- ✅ Error states are visually consistent with design system
- ✅ Labels and help text follow design system guidelines

## Areas for Future Improvement

While the current implementation meets WCAG 2.2 AA standards, the following areas could be enhanced in future iterations:

1. **Enhanced Screen Reader Announcements**: Add more context-specific announcements for complex interactions
2. **Expanded Keyboard Shortcuts**: Implement additional keyboard shortcuts for power users
3. **Focus Management**: Improve focus management for modals and dynamic content
4. **Color Contrast Analyzer**: Implement automated color contrast checking in the build process

## Conclusion

The Employee Experience Platform meets WCAG 2.2 AA compliance requirements. The application is perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust for all users, including those with disabilities. The UI components align with the Access Group Storybook design system, ensuring a consistent and accessible user experience.
